We can send a request to register a new user with the above UUID in the url. 
Our server can take that id and find the Invitation object in the database 
and then compare the expiry date with current time. If all of 
these conditions are true we would let the user register, otherwise send an 
error response back. For now we will return the Invitation Object to the client as a 
workaround. Email support will get implemented next in Part 3.
